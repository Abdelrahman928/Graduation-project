# Graduation-prooject
an API for graduation project's mobile app using Laravel.
the project idea was about managing waste, a smart basket that filters the waste and gives a redeemable code based on the waste type which will be transfered into points in the mobile application, these point can be redeemed throug a vendor for buying a product or a service.

this API was not finished and it has alot of improvements, readjustments and features to add, i don't know if i will ever finish it though since the project developing process stopped.
